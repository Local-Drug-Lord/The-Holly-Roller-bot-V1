# The Holy Roller

## What Is The Holy Roller?

The Holy Roller is a general purpose discord bot made and managed by me (Local_Drug_Lord). The bot had its first real release on the 17th of january 2024 with added support for more than one server 6 months later with the help of Postgresql. This addition of the database is what I've come to call V1 of the bot as i had to more or less redo the whole thing from scratch. 

As of recently I've come to the decision to make the code open source, do I recommend using my code? No, not at all. Why? Well where do I start?
1, It's really shitty code.
2, I'm not a professional programmer and shall not be trusted.
3, There is bugs, lots of bugs. (I'm working on some of them, if you find anything please make a thingy in the issues tab and i shall take a look at it. Don't forget to use the template :) )
4, Coding is fun, make your own bot from scratch.
5, I don't trust myself when it comes to good code.

## Why Is The Holy Roller?

I had been thinking about making a discord bot for some time. I'm strongly against how some bot makers are putting major (and non major) features behind a paywalls so I decided to make my own. "How hard can it be!" I said back then, if you ask me now I'll just pull out a gun and shoot myself. I really hate programming if I'm honest but I do also find something quite fun in it, I also love seeing the results and looking at the bot thinking about all the hours I've put into it. There's a special feeling about it all.

## How Do I Use The Bot Myself? (Myself being you the user/server owner)

Well there's two ways of doing it:
- Add the bot to your server using this ([link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1197233793640177726)).
- Or copy paste my code. (Which is a pain in the ass that takes time to set up)

### Dependencies

* Python 3 or older
* Pip (to install the rest)
* Postgres database set up properly (see Database.md)
* A discord bot account thingy
* A apikeys.py that's all set up to specs (just fill up where it says to fill up)
Pip packs:
* Discord.py
* Asyncpg (Used to connect and send/remove/view database data in Postgre)

### Starting the bot

Confirm that everything is set up and working as it should, then just run Main.py on an old laptop running ubuntu that you shove into a closet and then forget about (or just run it on a real server).
Do not forget to read through the whole README.md, TOS-and-EUA.md and Database.md. Negligence could lead to problems like:
- Errors (Critical and non critical)
- Forgotten settings/dependencies
- A bloody awful pain in the ass

## Help

If you need any help or find a bug you're free to join the discord server and ask for help or make an issue post in the github repository.
